# RC2014 Hacks Journal

## 04102020

My RC2014 Classic kit came a few days ago.  I haven't had time to start building it yet, but I've already started gathering information and even did a few experiments with building a video adapter out of an Arduino.

The Classic kit comes with everything you need to get up-and-running with BASIC, and it might even include some other things in the ROM (I still need to [look-up](https://rc2014.co.uk/1515/decoding-rom-labels/) what's install on the ROM I recieved.

That said there's a few things that I want to add.  These will likely wait until I get the kit assembled and running, but I'm researching them in the time I have that I can't spend with a soldering iron in hand.

* Video/keyboard interface (so I don't need a second computer just to use it)
* Mass storage device (I'm leaning *hard* toward cassette)
* A nice case based off of the original RAIN/RAIDEN "blue box" chassis
